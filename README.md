# Insights

Identified key drivers of flight delays across 5.8M+ records, enabling actionable insights into operational efficiency, scheduling optimization, and network reliability.
1. The weekday flight volume is significantly higher than weekends, which directly correlates with increased arrival and departure delays.
   
3. JetBlue Airways recorded a notably higher number of cancelled flights on the first day of each month compared to other days.
   
5. The KPIs show ~2.09M arrival-delayed flights and ~2.13M departure-delayed flights, indicating a strong dependency between the two.

6. Southwest Airlines consistently recorded the highest arrival and departure delays, while Virgin America and Hawaiian Airlines showed better on-time performance.

7. Flights covering 2500–3000 miles achieved 66.33% reliability, with several airlines experiencing zero arrival or departure delays in this segment.
